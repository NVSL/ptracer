/*
 * pt_capture2.c -- capture an Intel PT trace of one command for the offline reconstructor.
 *   --aux-out FILE    write the raw AUX (PT packet) bytes to FILE
 *   --sideband FILE   write a JSON sideband: pid, exit status, the union of the
 *                     traced process's /proc/PID/maps (polled while it runs), CPU
 *                     family/model/stepping, CPUID.15H, MTC period, perf clock params.
 * It can also report packet-level statistics, with a focus on OVF (buffer overflow) packets.
 *
 * Approach (raw perf_event_open + libipt, no `perf` CLI needed):
 *   1. Configure an intel_pt event with BRANCH tracing + TSC + MTC timing
 *      (user space only), disabled, enable-on-exec.
 *   2. fork(); the parent opens the event for the child PID, maps a large AUX
 *      buffer, then releases the child (via a pipe) to exec the benchmark.  The
 *      trace auto-enables on exec and flows into AUX.
 *   3. After the child exits, scan the AUX bytes with libipt's PACKET decoder
 *      (image-free) and count packet types, especially ppt_ovf.
 *
 * Usage: pt_capture2 [--aux-mb N] [--mtc-period P] [--ptw] [--no-ptw] [--aux-out F] [--sideband F] [--no-decode] [--no-drain] [--child-env V=X] -- <cmd> [args...]
 *   --scan   packet-count summary (default)
 *   exit 0 = captured & scanned; 2 = setup error.
 *
 * MULTI-THREADED CAPTURE.  `--cpu N' is REPEATABLE:
 * one per-CPU intel_pt event per core, the child pinned to exactly that set of cores, one AUX
 * file per core (`<aux-out>.cpu<N>' when there is more than one) and ONE sideband.  Every
 * per-CPU event records `context_switch' records (PERF_RECORD_SWITCH_CPU_WIDE /
 * ITRACE_START with PERF_SAMPLE_TID|TIME|CPU) which the drain thread copies into a binary
 * switch file per core (`<sideband>.cpu<N>.sw', struct sw_rec below), so the offline stage
 * can attribute every [TIP.PGE, TIP.PGD] region of a core's AUX stream to the thread that
 * ran it.  With `--sideband' the child is PTRACE_SEIZEd with PTRACE_O_TRACECLONE as well, so
 * every thread it creates is seen at its first stop and its `fs_base' (set by the kernel from
 * CLONE_SETTLS before the thread runs) is read with PTRACE_GETREGSET and written to the
 * sideband's `threads' list.  A single --cpu / per-task capture writes the same files and
 * JSON keys, plus the multi-threaded keys.

 * Recorded: every file-backed mapping, plus every ANONYMOUS EXECUTABLE mapping
 * -- above all `[vdso]'.  The vDSO is real, executed code (every
 * clock_gettime()/gettimeofday() call runs in it), so leaving it out of the
 * sideband makes libipt fail to decode there, lose synchronisation, and drop
 * every PTWRITE payload up to the next PSB.  There is no file to point libipt
 * at, so its bytes are dumped out of the target's own memory (/proc/PID/mem
 * while the target is at a ptrace stop) into <sideband>.<name>.bin and the
 * sideband names that file; the mapping keeps its kernel name in "name" so the
 * comparison tools can still recognise it as [vdso].
 *
 * The snapshots are taken only AFTER the child has execve()d (PTRACE_O_TRACEEXEC
 * stop) and again at its exit stop: polling before the exec recorded
 * pt_capture2's OWN image, its libc and libipt, whose addresses overlap the
 * target's mappings and corrupt the decode.

/* ---------------- draining AUX writer ------------
 *
 * The AUX area is mapped PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, which puts the PT event in
 * perf's NON-overwrite mode: the kernel fills [aux_tail, aux_tail+aux_size)
 * and then simply STOPS.  If nobody advances aux_tail, `aux_head' saturates at
 * `aux_size' and every capture is a PREFIX.  So a reader thread drains the
 * ring while the child runs and publishes aux_tail, exactly as perf's own
 * auxtrace_mmap__read() does: aux_head/aux_tail are FREE-RUNNING 64-bit byte
 * counters, the buffer position is (counter % aux_size), so a window that
 * straddles the end of the ring is two memcpy()s.
 *
 * Draining straight into the file is unreliable:
 *
 *   (1)     A disk can be slower than the PT stream an instrumented program
 *           generates.  Once enough dirty pages accumulate the kernel throttles
 *           the writer to device speed, a drain pass stalls, the AUX ring fills
 *           during that stall, and perf_aux_output_begin() then DISABLES the
 *           event (PERF_AUX_FLAG_TRUNCATED).
 *   (2)     A re-enable issued only after that same slow write returns, and only
 *           when the truncation COUNT has grown, can lose the race against the
 *           kernel's pending irq_work disable, or come after the child exited;
 *           the event then stays off for the rest of the run.
 *
 * So the burst is absorbed in RAM instead:
 *
 *   - the drain thread only ever memcpy()s the ring into a chunked STAGING
 *     queue (~10 GB/s) and publishes aux_tail immediately;
 *   - a separate WRITER thread moves staging to the file at whatever rate the
 *     disk gives, and keeps going after the child has exited;
 *   - the event is re-enabled BEFORE the write, and a WATCHDOG re-issues
 *     PERF_EVENT_IOC_ENABLE on every pass in which aux_head did not advance,
 *     which is what closes the pending_disable race (enabling a running event
 *     is a no-op in the kernel, so this is free and idempotent).
 *
 * Loss accounting: if the producer ever gets more than aux_size ahead of us the
 * oldest bytes are gone -- counted in g_aux_lost.  The kernel says the same
 * thing independently through PERF_RECORD_AUX records in the *data* ring, whose
 * PERF_AUX_FLAG_TRUNCATED bit is counted in g_aux_trunc_recs; that ring is
 * drained here too so it cannot fill either.
 *
 * PSB alignment is deliberately NOT enforced: this is a byte-exact copy of the
 * stream, and chunked/parallel decoding finds its own PSBs in the saved file.

 *
 * A per-CPU intel_pt event with `context_switch = 1' puts a PERF_RECORD_SWITCH_CPU_WIDE
 * record in the DATA ring at every switch on that core (and a PERF_RECORD_ITRACE_START
 * when the event starts), each carrying sample_id = { pid, tid, time, cpu } of the task
 * being switched in (or out).  With `exclude_kernel' the trace is off in ring 0, so a
 * core's AUX stream is a sequence of user regions [TIP.PGE, TIP.PGD] and a context switch
 * always lies in a gap between two of them: the region that starts at TIP.PGE time T
 * belongs to the LAST switch-in on that core with time <= T.  The record time is the perf
 * clock, which on this machine is derived from the TSC with exactly the parameters the
 * mmap page publishes (cap_user_time_zero: time_mult/time_shift/time_zero), so it is
 * converted back to the TSC domain of the PT packets here (perf's own perf_time_to_tsc),
 * and BOTH values are stored.  One binary file per core: `<sideband>.cpu<N>.sw'. */

/* ---- The TRACED run's environment must not be pt_capture2's own -----
 *
 * A `--gt-all' build is run with
 * `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<rewritten libc>' and `PTLOG_GT=1'.  When those are exported
 * around the whole command line -- which is the obvious way to write the script
 * -- *pt_capture2 itself* is dynamically linked
 * against the REWRITTEN libc.so.6 and starts recording its own memory accesses
 * into a ground-truth ring.  Two consequences, both silent:
 *   * every libc call in the tracer goes through an E9Patch trampoline, so the
 *     parent runs ~100x slower and writes its own multi-GB gt file;
 *   * when the tracer's own ring reaches PTLOG_GT_MAX the runtime "flushes and
 *     exits" -- `_exit()' from inside whatever the tracer was doing.  Hitting that
 *     inside write_sideband() leaves the JSON cut off at a 4 KiB stdio boundary;
 *     hitting it earlier loses the AUX file as well.  It only shows up when the CHILD exits early, because
 *     only a small PTLOG_GT_MAX is reached by the tracer's own trickle of accesses.
 *
 * So the tracee-only variables are QUARANTINED here: they are removed from our own
 * environment and handed to the child through `--child-env', after which this
 * process re-execs itself so that the ordinary system libc is loaded.  The child's
 * environment is bit-for-bit what the caller asked for; only the tracer's changes.
 * Gated on PTLOG_GT so that no other kind of run (a buffer-sink timing cell, say)
 * changes behaviour.  `--child-env' can also be used directly; the re-exec is the
 * fallback for callers that export the variables themselves.

     * ring is free, the hardware hits STOP within milliseconds and real trace is lost -- the "stale-AUX

     * Fix: keep the chunk order UNIFORM by choosing the watermark's order from /proc/buddyinfo so that
